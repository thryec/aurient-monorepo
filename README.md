**Aurient** is a decentralized health data marketplace that transforms health data into monetizable intellectual property assets. Built for the Story Protocol ecosystem, it specifically targets women's health data and positions itself as an AI-powered wellness insights platform that addresses gaps in traditional medical systems and wearable technology.

## üéØ Project Overview

Aurient enables users to:

- **Upload and Register**: Upload health data files and register them as IP assets on Story Protocol
- **Monetize Data**: Set pricing and earn royalties from data licensing
- **Browse Marketplace**: Discover and purchase health data licenses
- **AI Insights**: Get personalized health recommendations powered by AI
- **Secure Storage**: Store data on IPFS with blockchain ownership verification

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This monorepo contains three main components:

```
aurient-monorepo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contracts/          # Smart contracts (Solidity + Foundry)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/           # Next.js web application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aurient_data/       # Python data analysis toolkit
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This file
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** and npm/yarn
- **Python 3.8+** and pip

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

**Features:**

- Wallet connection (MetaMask, etc.)
- File upload to IPFS (PDF, JSON, CSV, TXT up to 50MB)
- Health data preview and metadata extraction
- IP registration on Story Protocol
- Marketplace for browsing and purchasing licenses
- User dashboard with earnings tracking

### 2. Smart Contracts (Foundry)

The blockchain infrastructure for IP registration, marketplace operations, and royalty distribution.

```bash
# Navigate to contracts directory
cd contracts

# Install Foundry (if not already installed)
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Install dependencies
forge install

# Build contracts
forge build

# Run tests
forge test
```

**Key Features:**

- Health data IP registration and NFT minting
- Marketplace listings and license sales
- Automated royalty distribution
- WIP token integration for payments
- Quality metrics tracking

### 3. Data Analysis Toolkit (Python)

AI-powered health data analysis with Oura Ring integration and personalized insights.

```bash
# Navigate to aurient_data directory
cd aurient_data

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run demo analysis
python oura_demo.py

# Launch interactive dashboard
streamlit run oura_streamlit_app.py
```

**Features:**

- Comprehensive Oura Ring data analysis (14 datasets)
- AI-powered health insights using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Interactive visualizations and statistics
- Personalized recommendations based on age and goals
- Data quality assessment and missing value analysis

## üì± Live Application

**üåê Live Site:** [https://aurient.vercel.app/](https://aurient.vercel.app/)

The live application includes:

- **Landing Page**: Platform overview and features
